# blackmaRble

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of blackmaRble is to facilitate processing of blackmarble VNP46A suite images. Below a work-flow is demonstrated illustrating how to use the package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of blackmaRble from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("zackarno/blackmaRble")
```
## Intro

This rmd demonstrates how to reproject and mosaic rasters downloaded from WorldView. It assumes you are downloading tiles from VNP46A NRT or Standard v001 collections and saving them to a directory. The easiest way to use `blackmaRble` is to save all the `.h5` format raster tiles to 1 directory and run the functions on the entire directory.

## Downloading Data

You can use [NASA - LAADS WorldView Portal](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/) to search for imagery

- Use blue-yellow composite imagery to better understand cloud formations & atmospheric effects
- If downloading data from the last ~ 72 hours you will need to DL from the NRT collection
- It is possible that you will get a message saying the imagery from the NRT collection is not available. If this happens it is because you are somehow logged into LAADs system, but not the NRT catalog. In this case go to the [NRT Portal](https://nrt3.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/archive/allData/5000/VNP46A1G_NRT/2022/073) and click log in.

**I will add to this section- with screenshots**



## Load libraries

- download `blackmaRble` if necessary  (commented out in chunk below)
- parameterize writing output option. 

```{r eval=F}
library(tidyverse)

# devtools::install_github("zackarno/blackmaRble")
library(blackmaRble)
library(here)
library(terra)


write_rasters <-  c(T,F)[1] # toggle 1 for write outputs, 2 for no outputs
```

## Reproject VNP46A data

- using list of file names & list of of full path names we can read in all the files in the folder and reproject them all at once
- results are saved in list object: `ntl_reprojected`

```{r pressure, echo=T, eval=F}
# dir.create("ntl_h5")



h5_filenames <- list.files(here::here("ntl_h5/"),pattern = "\\.h5$")
h5_paths <- list.files(here::here("ntl_h5/"), full.names = T,pattern = "\\.h5$")



ntl_reprojected <- h5_paths |> 
  map(~vnp46A_to_wgs84(path =.x)) |> 
  set_names(h5_filenames)
```

## Subset bands

- to simplify list object lets just subset each item in list to the DNB band
- new object `dnb_radiance` contains only `DNB_At_Sensor_Radiance_500m` band for each item in list.

```{r , eval=F}
# subset to just main band of interest for faster mosaicing
dnb_radiance <- ntl_reprojected |> 
  map(~.x |> subset("DNB_At_Sensor_Radiance_500m"))

```


# Mosaic & write rasters 
- since study area is composed of 4 tiles we need to mosaic them together
- function below uses NASA naming syntax to group tiles together by `DOY` and then mosaic them
- specify `output` to automatically write as tiff to specified directory
- result is also saved as `spatRaster collection`

```{r,eval=F}
# dir.create("ntl_doy_tiffs")

if(write_rasters){
  ntl_rad_by_doy <-  mosaic_vnp46a_by_doy(dnb_radiance,output = here::here("ntl_doy_tiffs"))
}
# ntl_rad_by_doy$`084`
```
